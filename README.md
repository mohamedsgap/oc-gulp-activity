## About
This repository contains the required activity (about using Gulp to automate build tasks) to pass the course on OpenClassrooms called write JS for the web.


### Evaluation criteria
* The project is built correctly when running the "gulp" command.
* Once Gulp has finished building your project, it launches it in the browser.
* If any files are changed while the development server is running, the browser live-reloads.
* The project, once built, works in exactly the same way as before the build (both pages).
* The development server must run the  dist  build, not the original files.
